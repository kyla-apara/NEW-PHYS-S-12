  # Week 7: Electronic Input Devices 

Week 7 was electronic input devices! The assignement description was:

1.) Use an output device that you haven't used before. 

2.) Write a microcontroller program that integrates at least one input device and one output device whie avoiding the delay function and use the C++ class structure.

3.) Use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain at which your output device is operating.

4.) Prepare CAD files for CNC next class. 

Here's what I did!


# Output Device: LED Strips

In class, for the output device I had never used before, I chose the LED Strip. The only requirement was that at least 4 individual LEDs in the strip would have a different color. I started off by installing the Adafruit Neopixel Library with the library manager. I opened the strandtest code into Ardiuno and read over the instructions and explanations from the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use">Adafruit website.</a>
