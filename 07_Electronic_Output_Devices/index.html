  # Week 7: Electronic Input Devices 

Week 7 was electronic input devices! The assignement description was:

1.) Use an output device that you haven't used before. 

2.) Write a microcontroller program that integrates at least one input device and one output device whie avoiding the delay function and use the C++ class structure.

3.) Use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain at which your output device is operating.

4.) Prepare CAD files for CNC next class. 

Here's what I did!


## Output Device: LED Strips

In class, for the output device I had never used before, I chose the LED Strip. The only requirement was that at least 4 individual LEDs in the strip would have a different color. I started off by installing the Adafruit Neopixel Library with the library manager. I opened the strandtest code into Ardiuno and read over the instructions and explanations from the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use" target="_blank">Adafruit website.</a> 

After soddering on the 3 wires to my LED strip, I connected it to my arduino. I then shortend down the code from the strandtest because I only needed to color the 4 LEDs. I set my order to red, green, blue and mageta. Here is my code!

## One Input Device & One Output Device!

For this portion of the assignment I used the previous copper tape input device and the led strip I just made. I connected the two functions with a conditional statement so it will turn off and on at certain values. Here is the code!

 After inputting my code I tested my range and adjusted the values so if the result of the copper wire is greater than 7500 the LEDs will turn on and if the value is less than 8000 then the LEDs will turn off.

 After getting the input and output devices to work, I then had to create a class. Although my code did not use any delay functions and already had a pre-made class that came with the example, the assignment requirement was to utilize a class of our own. I decided the best way to do this would be to subsitute a button for the copper pieces to turn on the LED and make a class for that button. I used the Arduino Digital Button Example. However, after multiple attempts at trying to modify/intergrate the code from the LED strip to the button, it was unsuccessful. 

Here's my Attempted Code Alongside my Circuit and Breadboard

#define LED_COUNT 7
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
// constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  6;      // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  
  strip.begin();           // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Updates the whole strip at once
  strip.setBrightness(50); // Set BRIGHTNESS to about 1/5 (max = 255)

}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }
}

While I did not get the button to turn on the LED strip (therefore I was not able to create my own class) I definitly learned a couple of tips and became a lot more comfortable when trying to code on Arduino!


## Using the Oscilloscope!

Before I switched to using the button, I decided to record the current waveforms that were flowing throughout the LED with copper pieces by using the oscilloscope. This was the result after I ran it through the machine.


![Image of the oscilloscope](./osteo.jpg) 


Because my output device was an LED strip, the wavelength was constant and in place. Compared to something like a piezo buzzer which would probably show up in some sort of on and off pattern. 

Basic Information the picture shows:

Frequency: >10 Hz


## Designing CAD Models!

The lat part to this assignment was simply designing a cad model (either a 3D STL file or a 2D DXF file) to use for next assignments CNC milling project. I chose one of my trays that I am going to need for my final project! The CNC machiene however, cannot cut the holes where one of the bases of my robot will attach. To deal with this, I will have to use my second robot base or find a way to accurately cut the holes. Here is what both the tray and second robot base look like!


![Image of the tray](./Shelf_No_Holes.png)

![Image of the robot base](./Robot_Base_1.png)


For the tray, I started off with a 7 inch or 177.80mm square. I extruded the square by 10mm and began to build up the sides. For each side of the tray, the dimensions for the sketch was 177.80mm in length, 25.4mm in width, and I extruded the sketch by 10mm on all sides. 


![Image of the tray base](./Shelf_Base.png)

![Image of the tray sides](./Shelf_Sides.png)


After making the tray I decided to make the robot base that will scoup under the trays. I started off with a 8 inch or 203.2mm by 4 in or 101.6mm rectangle. 


![Image of the robot base](./Robot_Base.png)


Then, I added a prong type of shape. The inital idea was that when the robot scoups the tray up it will have prongs that could lift the top corners first so it would be easy to slide on. I added two 77mm x 8.5mm rectangles on each side. I also made two rectangles that would face inwards (to lift the corners) which were 25.025mm and 8.5mm.


![Image of the robot prongs](./Robot_Prong.png)


After this was done I extruded the sketch by 2mm so it could be thin enough to easily slide under the trays and then built up the sides. I created a new sketch on the side and made a 8 inch/203mm by 1 inch/25.4mm rectangle on the length of the base sketch for the robot. For the two other width sides on the robot base, I created two 4 inch/101.6mm by 1 inch/25.4mm rectangles and extruded the images by 1 inch/25.4mm on either side.
