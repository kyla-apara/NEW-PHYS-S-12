  ### Week 4: Microcontroler Programming 
For this weeks assignement we were tasked with programming an Arduino board to do something. We recently learned how to complete a basic cirit and experiemented with turning on LED lights, as well as givving commands to moters such as, spinning backwards for 4 seconds then another 4 seconds forwards. We also played around with changing the speed and got more comfortable using output devices such as a button. With this assignment while we were able to use our previous assignment I decided to change things up. Because I had already incorperated my Week 2 and Week 3 assignments I decided to make a new structure and build a mini golf windmill to be the kinetic sculpture I need to move with my Arduino.
