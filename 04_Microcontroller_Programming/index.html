  # Week 4: Microcontroler Programming 

For this weeks assignement we were tasked with programming an Arduino board to do something. We recently learned how to complete a basic cirit and experiemented with turning on LED lights, as well as givving commands to moters such as, spinning backwards for 4 seconds then another 4 seconds forwards. We also played around with changing the speed and got more comfortable using output devices such as a button. With this assignment while we were able to use our previous assignment I decided to change things up. Because I had already incorperated my Week 2 and Week 3 assignments I decided to make a new structure and build a mini golf windmill to be the kinetic sculpture I need to move with my Arduino. 

## Building the Windmill

I started off designing the different components of the windmill in Fusion360 after looking briefly at some reference pictures. I decdided on basic shapes then would build on it later. I sketched different sized two point rectangles for both the fan pieces and walls, with one rectangle wall having an arched hole cut out of it by using the 3 point curve tool. These were my measurements:

Wall Width: 101.6mm or 5 inches

Wall Length: 152.4mm or 7 inches

Fan Piece Width: 25.4mm or 1 inch

Fan Piece Length: 76.2mm or 3 inches

Once I was done sketching I downloaded my sketches as a DXF file onto my USB and took it to the laser cutter. These were the cut out pieces.
