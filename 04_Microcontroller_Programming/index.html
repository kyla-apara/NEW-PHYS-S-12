  # Week 4: Microcontroler Programming 

For this weeks assignement we were tasked with programming an Arduino board to do something. We recently learned how to complete a basic circuit and experiemented with turning on LED lights, as well as how to give commands to moters such as, spinning backwards for 4 seconds then another 4 seconds forwards. We also played around with changing the speed and got more comfortable using input devices such as a button. With this assignment we were able to use our previous work but, I decided to change things up. Because I had already incorperated my Week 2 and Week 3 assignments, I decided to make a new kinetic structure and build a moving mini golf windmill with my Arduino. 

## Building the Windmill

 After briefly looking at some reference pictures, I started off designing the different components of the windmill in Fusion360. I decdided on basic shapes and would build on it later. For the base I sketched different sized two point rectangles for both the fan pieces and walls, with one rectangle wall having an arched hole cut out of it by using the 3 point curve tool. These were my measurements:

Wall Width: 101.6mm or 5 inches

Wall Length: 152.4mm or 7 inches

Wind Blade Width: 25.4mm or 1 inch

Wind Blade Length: 76.2mm or 3 inches

Once I was done sketching I downloaded my sketches as a DXF file onto my USB and took it to the laser cutter. These were the cut out pieces.

I began to hot glue the wall pieces together and traced the outline of the top to hand cut a roof to go onto the model. This was because the laser cutter did not cut all the way through the cardboard. After the basic shape was done, I realised the "fan" parts were way too small so, I redesigned much larger ones and attempted to use the laser cutter to cut those out but, I eventually had to go back and trace it with a box cutter again. However, I saw a new way to repurpose the old fans which was by attaching them, with hot glue, to the new ones as a way for the wind blades to be connected easily. While this did make my structure a little unstable it definitely helped the process of connecting the parts easier.

After making all of my fan pieces I stacked them up and drilled a hole in the middle to put a wooden dowel in it. I measured the width of the top of the base and cut the dowel to be around 2 to 3 inches longer. I threaded the dowel through the hole and secured it on the other side with hot glue. I originally put a curled up piece of cardboard on the top in an attempt to find a way to connect the dowel with the motor but ended up scratching the idea entirely.

I eyeballed how high the fan needed to be so the bottom of the wind blades would just barley cover the hole where golf balls would normally go. Once the dowel was stuck through the top I realised I would need some sort of platform or structure to make sure the dowel would be able stay in place at that height. I built a suport structure out of scrap cardboard to the height I had already decided. I also made another structure in the front with a dip in the middle for the dowel to spin. I made this structure a little bit taller than the rest so the fan part would tilt upwards and not hit the base of the windmill.

Now was the most challenging part of this assignment, connecting the fan part of the windmill to the motor. I tried and thought of many ideas that were all unsucessful. I needed a way to connect the two pieces but in a way so they could also be removable in case I needed the motor for any future projects. My solution circled back to the wheel the motor orginally comes with from my previous assignment. I hot glued the wheel to the dowel and then attached the wheel to the motor. This worked perfectly as the wheel also acted as a counter weight to the heavy cardboard. Then, I used cut, drilled, and reglued pieces of cardboard to provide more support to the dowel as I figured out, through testing, that the dowel would often fall out of the support structure because of the amount of power from the motor and how the dip from the carboard was not an accurate size since it was done freehanded.

Eventually I ended up with the full piece looking like this!

## This Is My Coding!!

In order to set the pattern of the motor I used Arduino to create the spinning cycle.

This means that, when turned on, the wind blades would spin in one direction for 3 seconds, spin the other way for 3 seconds, spin again for 1 second then spin the other way for 1 second, on a loop.

After the model of the windmill, motor programming, and circuit connections were done the final result for my fan was made!
