  # Week 4: Microcontroler Programming 

For this weeks assignement we were tasked with programming an Arduino board to do something. We recently learned how to complete a basic cirit and experiemented with turning on LED lights, as well as givving commands to moters such as, spinning backwards for 4 seconds then another 4 seconds forwards. We also played around with changing the speed and got more comfortable using output devices such as a button. With this assignment while we were able to use our previous assignment I decided to change things up. Because I had already incorperated my Week 2 and Week 3 assignments I decided to make a new structure and build a mini golf windmill to be the kinetic sculpture I need to move with my Arduino. 

## Building the Windmill

I started off designing the different components of the windmill in Fusion360 after looking briefly at some reference pictures. I decdided on basic shapes then would build on it later. I sketched different sized two point rectangles for both the fan pieces and walls, with one rectangle wall having an arched hole cut out of it by using the 3 point curve tool. These were my measurements:

Wall Width: 101.6mm or 5 inches

Wall Length: 152.4mm or 7 inches

Fan Piece Width: 25.4mm or 1 inch

Fan Piece Length: 76.2mm or 3 inches

Once I was done sketching I downloaded my sketches as a DXF file onto my USB and took it to the laser cutter. These were the cut out pieces.

I then began to hot glue the wall pieces together and traced the outline of the top to put a roof on the model. After the basic shape was done I realised the "fan" parts were way too small so I redesigned much larger ones and used the laser cutter to cut those out. I also saw a new way to repurpose the old ones which was by attaching them, with hot glue, to the new ones as a way for the fan to be connected easily. While this did make my structure a little unstable it definitely helped my the process of connecting the fan parts easier.

After making all of my fan pieces I stacked them up and drilled a hole in the middle to put a wooden dowel in it. I measured the width of the top of the base and cut the dowel to be around 2 to 3 inches longer. I threaded the dowel through the hole and secured it on the other side with hot glue. I originally put cardboard on the top in an attempt to find a way to connect the dowel with the motor but ended up scratching the idea entirely.

I measured how high the fan needed to be so the bottom of the wind blades would just barley cover the hole where golf balls would normally go. Once the dowel was stuck through the top I realised I would need some sort of platform or structure to make sure the dowel would be able stay in place at that height. I built a suport structure a little bit taller than I needed so the fan part would tilt upwards and not hit the base of the windmill.

Now was the most challenging part of this assignment, connecting the fan part of the windmill to the motor. I tried and thought of many ideas that were all unsucessful. I needed a way to connect the two pieces but in a way so they could also be removable in case I needed the motor for any future projects. My solution circled back to the wheel the motor orginally comes with from my previous assignment. I hot glued the wheel to the dowel and then attached the wheel to the motor. This worked perfectly as the wheel also acted as a counter weight to the heavy cardboard. I also used drilled, cut, and reglued pieces of cardboard to provide more support to th dowel as I figured out through testing the dowel would often fall out of the support structure because of the amount of power from the motor.

## This Is My Coding!!

In order to set the pattern of the motor I used Arduino to create the spinning cycle.
