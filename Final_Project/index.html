  # Final Project! 

   The Proposal: My current idea/rough sketch for my final project is a remote controlled cubical storage unit with sensory shelves. These shelves would be able to sense where the person in need of help is and deliver any supplies to them. The goal is to help people with limited movement gain access to anything they might need. With the project, I plan to use it as a tool to help my mother easily have all her medical devices in one space and hopefully be able to create something that is convenient and lots of people find useful.

Revised Proposal: After thinking more about what I want to do, I redrew my ideas in a little bit more detail. I think it would be cool to have a conveyer belt system that can be easily hung on a wall similar to a normal shelf. I decided the actual cubbies with the trays inside of them would be higher than the conveyor belt and I could try to program a way for the machine to move up and down to retrieve items. The model would be controlled with buttons that corrispond to the shelves and would know which way to go on the conveyor belt based on the location of the person that pressed the button. 


Update: At the moment I am unsure of how I want the robot grabber to move. The two ideas I have is for the machine to sense where to move upwards on its own or, have it be stationary on a conveyor belt in order to latch onto the trays inside of the cubicals. I would perfer the first option because the robot would be more versitile on normal shelving but I dont know if it will be as successful. To make the project without a conveyor belt is possibe especially if I can create a pully system to get the robot up to grab the items instead. It would also be less expensive and easier to simply add wheels to it rather than buy/make a conveyor belt.

## Current List of Materials & Machinery that I Need: 
(Most Things I Can Find in the Lab)

- 12, 8 inch wood planks

- 6 inch by 6 inch plastic trays

- 3D Printer for the robot casing

- Possibly molding and casting material for wheels

- Normal wood planks for shelving

- Spraypaint or normal paint

- Battery pack


## Planning the workload:

July 12th: Detailed Robot Sketch Complete

July 14th: Main Components Done & Measurement Checks (Cubicals, Shelving Cut to Size and Any Resizing Adjustments)

July 19th: Start Making the Robot

July 27th: First Test Run

July 30th: Doing Test Runs and Minor Changes


I also recently designed CAD Models by using Fusion360 to get a better look at what I might want my main components to look like! After redevoloping my ideas I have fully decided to add wheels to my robot and have it work similar to a forklift in warehouses. The robot would alig and attach itself with a shelf and then after the weight is removed it will put the shelf back.

## Creating the Prototype 
I went to the lasercutter and cut out my pieces. After cutting the pieces, I also flattened out the base of the scoup with the table clamps we have for sawing.

Then I used hotglue and started putting them together starting from the tray and adding adjustments as I go. I measured the height I wanted the scoup to be and eyeblled the positioning of where I should attach it to the base (later I would find out this was a mistake and would cause a headache.)

A couple of modifications (that werent apart of the plan) was adding the ramp inside of the box with an extra 5in/127mm square that I was going to use for the "circuit casing." I did this so the tray would be elevated and have a gap for the scoup to slide under. I also extended the platform of the back of the robot in order to add more wheels. This will balance out the weight and make the robot more stable (or as stable as it can be, since I'm using cardboard.)

After this was done, I was stuck. For a total of two days I had no idea where to go from there. The biggest problem I faced was trying to get the scoup to stand up by itself. It would droop down because of its weight. One method I tried to use in order to fix it was putting the scoup on the same level as the robot base as it was previously attached a little further down. I decontructed the cardboard and rehot glued everything.

While reattached, the idea didnt seem to work. Despite this I didnt try to take it apart again as the previous fight with the cardboard was exhausting. I then realised how flexible cardboard was especially with the hot glue. I figured I could find a way to incorperate the stepper motor with string to pull up the scoup.

I also added the side walls and little tower that I decidd to put my stepper motor on.
