  # Final Project! 

   The Proposal: My current idea/rough sketch for my final project is a remote controlled cubical storage unit with sensory shelves. These shelves would be able to sense where the person in need of help is and deliver any supplies to them. The goal is to help people with limited movement gain access to anything they might need. With the project, I plan to use it as a tool to help my mother easily have all her medical devices in one space and hopefully be able to create something that is convenient and lots of people find useful.

Revised Proposal: After thinking more about what I want to do, I redrew my ideas in a little bit more detail. I think it would be cool to have a conveyer belt system that can be easily hung on a wall similar to a normal shelf. I decided the actual cubbies with the trays inside of them would be higher than the conveyor belt and I could try to program a way for the machine to move up and down to retrieve items. The model would be controlled with buttons that corrispond to the shelves and would know which way to go on the conveyor belt based on the location of the person that pressed the button. 


Update: At the moment I am unsure of how I want the robot grabber to move. The two ideas I have is for the machine to sense where to move upwards on its own or, have it be stationary on a conveyor belt in order to latch onto the trays inside of the cubicals. I would perfer the first option because the robot would be more versitile on normal shelving but I dont know if it will be as successful. To make the project without a conveyor belt is possibe especially if I can create a pully system to get the robot up to grab the items instead. It would also be less expensive and easier to simply add wheels to it rather than buy/make a conveyor belt.

## Current List of Materials & Machinery that I Need: 
(Most Things I Can Find in the Lab)

- 12, 8 inch wood planks

- 6 inch by 6 inch plastic trays

- 3D Printer for the robot casing

- Possibly molding and casting material for wheels

- Normal wood planks for shelving

- Spraypaint or normal paint

- Battery pack


## Planning the workload:

July 12th: Detailed Robot Sketch Complete

July 14th: Main Components Done & Measurement Checks (Cubicals, Shelving Cut to Size and Any Resizing Adjustments)

July 19th: Start Making the Robot

July 27th: First Test Run

July 30th: Doing Test Runs and Minor Changes


I also recently designed CAD Models by using Fusion360 to get a better look at what I might want my main components to look like! After redevoloping my ideas I have fully decided to add wheels to my robot and have it work similar to a forklift in warehouses. The robot would alig and attach itself with a shelf and then after the weight is removed it will put the shelf back.
