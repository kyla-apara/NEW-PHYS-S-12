  ### Final Project! 

   The Proposal: My current idea/rough sketch for my final project is a remote controlled cubical storage unit with sensory shelves. These shelves would be able to sense where the person in need of help is and deliver any supplies to them. The goal is to help people with limited movement gain access to anything they might need. With the project, I plan to use it as a tool to help my mother easily have all her medical devices in one space and hopefully be able to create something that is convenient and lots of people find useful.

Revised Proposal: After thinking more about what I want to do specifically, I redrew my ideas in a little bit more detail. I think it would be cool to have a conveyer belt system that can be easily hung on a wall similar to a normal shelf. I decided the actual cubbies with the trays inside of them would be higher than the conveyor belt and I could try to program a way for the machine to move up and down to retrieve items. The model would be controlled with buttons that corrispond to the shelves and would know which way to go on the conveyor belt based on the location of the person that pressed the button.

2nd Proposal: Recently, I have been interested in motion tracking. I took inspiration from the previous years from a robotic arm. There is a minuature model that moves the actual model along with it. I beleieve making an accordion, or folding type of sculpture that can match the pattern of the miniature model would be interesting as it would have a wide range of motion. However, I think the first idea is more realistic given my time frame and coding abilities.
