  ### Final Project! 

   The Proposal: My current idea/rough sketch for my final project is a remote controlled cubical storage unit with sensory shelves. These shelves would be able to sense where the person in need of help is and deliver any supplies to them. The goal is to help people with limited movement gain access to anything they might need. With the project, I plan to use it as a tool to help my mother easily have all her medical devices in one space and hopefully be able to create something that is convenient and lots of people find useful.
