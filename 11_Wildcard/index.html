  # Week 11: Wildcard

  For this week we were introduced to resources and other Makerspaces in different areas! There were also short demos on how to use certain machienery that we hadn't gotten to use like the water jet, embroidery machine, and vaccum former. Other than that, we did not have any assignments or documentation neccissary. I used this time to think more about my final project and ready my CAD files to start my second prototype. 
   
  Use this to go back to the homepage! [link](../index.html).
