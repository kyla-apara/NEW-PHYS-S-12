  # Week 9: Radio, Wifi, and Bluetooth

For this weeks assignment, we were tasked with controling a board from a local wireless network. We also had to program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. I decided to build something that I could use for my final project.
   
## Using the ESP32!

I knew I wanted to crete something that would be useful for my final project. I decided that controlling the robot through wifi would be a good addition and so I connected the two motors to it. Orginally I started off with one motor and used <a href="http://www.esp32learning.com/code/esp32-and-l9110-fan-module-example.php" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to create the circuit and gather the code for the ESP32 (You must right click on the blank space and open the image in a new tab to see the circuit schematic). This part was relativly easy as I have worked with DC Motors before and it was pretty similar to other microcontrollers where I changed the direction of them. Here was the result for the first test of the ESP32 just to make sure the connection was fine.

Once I tested the code, I then decided to input my previous turning pattern code from Week 4 where the motor would turn forwards and backwards (Check week 4 for the specific code!) I also added a second motor by copying and pasting the same code but setting different input pins for Motor B. However, because the code was seperated, instead of the two motors rotating together in sync, they operated one after the other.

  <source src="Chrono.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 


 To fix this mistake I simply combined the code into the same sections and it happened to work!

After getting the two motors to work at the same time, I knew that I would want my robot to be able to turn. I learned the easiest way to do this was by having one wheel spin in one continuous direction while having the other one rotate the other way. I simple switched the outputs for Motor B from LOW to HIGH and vise versa for one spinning cycle and had Motor A continue spinning in the right direction. Here was the result, along with the code!

I also added wheels to the motors to see what it would look like while changing directions.

## Simple Wifi Server

To start off the requirements for this assignmnt and acatually get to the wifi connections part, after getting familiar with setting up the ESP32 I followed the tutorial provided by my teacher on how to use the Simple Wifi Server Library that I downloaded from the ESP32 examples. I started off by modifying the code by intergrading the motor code from above into the template provided, which was initailly about turning on a LED. The main thing I changed was the if statements, where I pasted most of my code.

 This example is written for a network using WPA2 encryption. For insecure
 WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call and use Wifi.setMinSecurity() accordingly.

For a while I had a hard time seeing where to control the motors from. You are supposed to control them through the server created when putting the IP Address that is displayed in the serial moniter. However, I quickly realised/remembered that when trying to see it, you must be connected tot he same wifi connection as the ESP32. From there, I simply clicked the link to turn the motors on and off!

## Firebase Tutorial

After getting the Simple Wifi Server up and running, I decided to take a look into the Firebase platform that we were reccommended. I set up a new Firebase Project named ESP32 Firebase Motor, and created a new account. From there, linked on my teachers website we learned how to nagivate through Firebase and its Realtime Database, along with the information we need to start connecting Firebase to the ESP32.

Here was my modified code!

After opening the serial moniter it will read "Motor Turned OFF" and you can turn it on through the Realtime database we created earlier and set the motor to ON. This will turn the motor on and you can pause it by switching it back to OFF. The results should also report back in your serial monitor.

## The Take Away!

I really found this week helpful. Because of the previous weeks, I had already become more comfortable an less intimidated by code. I was able to problem solve and troubleshoot any bugs within my code and only had to ask for help with minor adjustments! Overall I would say this weeks assignment was very successful!
