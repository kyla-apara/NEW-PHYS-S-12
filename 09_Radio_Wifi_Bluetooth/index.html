  # Week 9: Radio, Wifi, and Bluetooth

For this weeks assignment, we were tasked with controling a board from a local wireless network. We also had to program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. I decided to build something that I could use for my final project.
   
## Using the ESP32!

I knew I wanted to crete something that would be useful for my final project. I decided that controlling the robot through wifi would be a good addition so I decided to connect two motors to it. Orginally I started off with one motor and used <a href="http://www.esp32learning.com/code/esp32-and-l9110-fan-module-example.php" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to create the circuit.
