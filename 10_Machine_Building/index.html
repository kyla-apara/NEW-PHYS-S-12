  # Week 10: Machine Building & End Effectors

  As the program comes to the end, our last new assignment is Machine Building! The assignment description was to make a machine that includes at least one stepper motor, and demonstrate that we can calibrate the motor's starting position. I decided I could incorperate this into my final project and developed  prototype through trial and error.
   
## Building the Prototype

I already had the plan of what I wanted my first prototype to look like so I simply went to the lasercutter and cut out my pieces. (if you're interested in my measuremnts and specifics look at my final project page!)
