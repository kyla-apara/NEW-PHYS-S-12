  # Week 10: Machine Building & End Effectors

  As the program comes to the end, our last new assignment is Machine Building! The assignment description was to make a machine that includes at least one stepper motor, and demonstrate that we can calibrate the motor's starting position. I decided I could incorperate this into my final project and developed prototype through trial and error.
   
## Building the Prototype

I already had the plan of what I wanted my first prototype to look like so I simply went to the lasercutter and cut out my pieces. (if you're interested in my measuremnts and specifics look at my final project page!) After cutting the pieces, I also flattened out the base of the scoup with the table clamps we have for sawing.

Then I used hotglue and started putting them together starting from the tray and adding adjustments as I go. I measured the height I wanted the scoup to be and eyeblled the positioning of where I should attach it to the base (later I would find out this was a mistake and would cause a headache.)

A couple of modifications (that werent apart of the plan) was adding the ramp inside of the box with an extra 5in/127mm square that I was going to use for the "circuit casing." I did this so the tray would be elevated and have a gap for the scoup to slide under. I also extended the platform of the back of the robot in order to add more wheels. This will balance out the weight and make the robot more stable (or as stable as it can be, since I'm using cardboard.)

After this was done, I was stuck. For a total of two days I had no idea where to go from there. The biggest problem I faced was trying to get the scoup to stand up by itself. It would droop down because of its weight. One method I tried to use in order to fix it was putting the scoup on the same level as the robot base as it was previously attached a little further down. I decontructed the cardboard and rehot glued everything.

While reattached, the idea didnt seem to work. Despite this I didnt try to take it apart again as the previous fight with the cardboard was exhausting. I then realised how flexible cardboard was especially with the hot glue. I figured I could find a way to incorperate the stepper motor with string to pull up the scoup.

I also added the side walls and little tower that I decidd to put my stepper motor on.

Heres the prototype:
