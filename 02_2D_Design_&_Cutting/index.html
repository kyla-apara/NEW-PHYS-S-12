  ### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting

   For the second week, and offical first assignment of Digital Fabrication class, we were tasked with sketching and cutting out a 2D Press- Fit Kit with cardboard, following a Fusion360 tutorial, and recreating two household objects then using them in an assembly. For the kit, the only two requirements we were given happened to be: the model has to be interchangeable/assembled in different ways, and we must take into account the lasercutter kerf or, the difference between the outside measurements vs. the inside measurements once a piece is cut. With this said, I started with the press- fit kit.



   #### Flower Press- Fit Kit

   In class we briefly learned how to use the software Fusion360 to create our first 2D model of a square with notches. Once completing the in class tutorial, we were given the creative liberty to figure out what we wanted to do for our own Assembly Kits. I had many ideas however, the chosen one was interchangeable flowers. As a beginner, this was the inital drawing of the shape I wanted.

  After deciding on the shape, I opened Fusion360 and created a new sketch. I selected the XY 2D plane on the bottom and chose my shape with the create button, which was a circumscribed polygon with 8 sides. I then set myparametersor or, measurements. The edge length of the sides of the octogon would be 20mm, the notch length was 10mm into the octogon, the thickness of the cardboard was 3.5mm and the kerf was 0.4mm.

In order to get the correct size of the notch, I used a guided contruction line to split one of the sides in half. Then, I created half of the width for the notch by dividing the thickness by 2 and subtracting the kerf. This left me with 1.90mm for half of the thickness. For the length of the notch I measured a 10mm line from the outer edge of one of the sides drawing it inward.

Afterwards I was able to mirror the two lines using the same construction line and the mirror tool in order to get the full picture of one of the completed notches.

I then added the same notch to the rest of the 7 sides with the circular pattern button under the create tab, I entered in the number 8 as my shape had 8 sides.

After creating all of the notches I highlighted the main image and extruded it by 4mm by typing "E". Once the basic shape was done, I exported the file as a DXF and took my flashdrive to the FabLab to use the laser cutter, to bring it to life.

The final product resulted in a simple but successful piece. The take away for this project would be to be a little more ambitious. For the first project I decided to play it safe but, next time I will try to make things more interesting!

#### Following A Tutorial

Alongside our project we were tasked with following an aditional tutorial that would help us continue to hone our skills with Fusion360 for future projects. I reccomend the tutorial. Here's what I did!
