  ### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting

   For the second week, and offical first assignment, of Digital Fabrication class, we were tasked with sketching and cutting out a 2D Press- Fit Assembly Kit with cardboard. The only two requirements we were given happened to be: the model has to be interchangeable/assembled in different ways, and we must take into account the lasercutter kerf or, the difference between the outside measurements vs. the inside measurements once a piece is cut. In class we learned how to use the software Fusion360 to create our first 2D model of a square with notches. Once completing the in class tutorial, we were given the creative liberty to figure out what we wanted to do for our own Assembly Kits. I had many ideas however, the chosen one was a "bouquet of flowers." It started off as a simple notched octagon drawing but evolved after I became comfortable with the app. As ambitious as this may be for a beginner, this was the inital drawing of the rough shape I wanted.

  After deciding on the shape, I opened Fusion360 and created a new sketch. I selected the 2D plane on the bottom and chose my shape with the create button, which was a circumscribed polygon with 8 sides. I then set my parameters. The edge length of the sides of the octogon would be 20mm, the notch length was 10mm into the octogon, the thickness of the cardboard was 4.6mm and the kerf was 0.4mm.

In order to get the correct size of the notch, I used a guided contruction line to split one of the sides in half. Then, I created half of the width for the notch by dividing the thickness in half and subtracting the kerf. This left me with 1.90mm for half of the thickness. For the length of the notch I measured a 10mm line from the outer edge of one of the sides.

Afterwards I was able to mirror the image using the same construction line and the mirror tool.

I then added the same notch to the rest of the 7 sides with the circular pattern button under the create tab.
