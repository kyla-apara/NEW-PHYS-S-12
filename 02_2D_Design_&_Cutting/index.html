  ### Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting

   For the second week, and offical first assignment, of Digital Fabrication class, we were tasked with sketching and cutting out a 2D Press- Fit Assembly Kit. The only two requirements we were given happened to be: the model has to be interchangeable/assembled in different ways, and we must take into account the lasercutter kerf or, the difference between the outside measurements vs. the inside measurements once a piece is cut. In class we learned how to use the software Fusion360 to create our first 2D model of a square with notches. Once completing the in class tutorial we were given the creative liberty to figure out what we wanted to do for our own Assembly Kits. I had many ideas however, the chosen one was a "bouquet of flowers." It started off as a simple octagon drawing but evolved after I became comfortable with the app. As ambitious as this may be for  beginner, this was the inital drawing of the rough shape I wanted.

  After deciding on the shape I opened Fusion360 and created a new sketch, selecting the 2D plane on the bottom. I then selected my shape with the create button, which was a circumscribed polygon with 8 sides. I then set my parameters. The edge length of one side of the octogon would be 20mm. The notch length
