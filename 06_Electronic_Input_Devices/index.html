  # Week 6: Electronic Input Devices 

  This weeks assignment was to use a sensor from our kits to measure a physical quantity with our microcontroller and build a capacitive sensor by using copper tape, aluminum foil, Velostat, etc. We also had to calibrate both sensors or, describe the range between its minimum and maximum values as well as see whether we could control this range. Here's what I did!


  ## Building a Flex Sensor!

For the simple sensor in my kit I decided to build a flex sensor. I opened arduino uno and copy and pasted the code from the simple tutorial was posted on SparkFun. It is also where I got this circuit picture and schematic!

After connecting the circuit, I bent the flex sensor at different angles. I recorded the values by using the serial monitor and opened the serial plotter to see what the graph would look like. (For the graph in the tutorial it was reccomended we use the 9600 baud measurement.)

The Lowest Value: 10904.45 Ohms at -45.00 Degrees

The Highest Value: 38504.43 Ohms at 2.00 Degrees

Side Note: The INF Ohms or Infinite Ohms is the Flex Sensors resting/neutral state at -63.00.


## Building the Capacitive Sensor

For the capacitive sensor I built the transmit - recieve (TX_RX) sensor, by using the hand drawn schematic that was included in our teachers website.

After building the circuitry I opened the serial monitor and serial plotter to record and graph my data. The order of the number values are as shown where the first picture is its neutral state (not touching), the second picture is the two pieces of copper touching each other, and the last picture is the two pieces of copper being pushed together with my fingers.

The Highest Value:
