  ### Week 6: Electronic Input Devices 

  This weeks assignment was to use a sensor from our kits to measure a physical quantity with our microcontroller and build a capacitive sensor by using copper tape, aluminum foil, Velostat, etc. We also had to calibrate both sensors or, describe the range between its minimum and maximum values as well as see whether we could control this range. Here's what I did!

  ## Building a Flex Sensor!

For the simple sensor in my kit I decided to build a flex sensor. The simple tutorial was posted on SparkFun and it is also where I got this circuit picture and schematic!

After connecting the circuit, I bent the flex sensor at different angles. I recorded the values by using the serial monitor and opened the serial plotter to see what the graph would look like.
