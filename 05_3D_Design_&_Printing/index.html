  ### Week 5: 3D Design & Printing 

   Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kyla Apara, I am 16 years old and a rising junior at Somerset Academy Losee in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am excited to learn new things in my new Introduction to Digital Fabrication course at Harvard Summer School. I currently have no experience in digital fabrication or coding however, I do have an interest in art, design, and architecture. In my spare time I enjoy crochetting, participating on my school track team, and spending time with my family. Specifically, I like hanging out with my mom, who is my biggest supporter and constantly encourages me to challenge myself.

  My current rough idea for my final project is a remote controlled cubical with sensory shelves that can help people with limited movement access supplies.
