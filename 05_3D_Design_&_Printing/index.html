  # Week 5: 3D Design & Printing 

   This weeks project is 3D Printing! When saying digital fabrication the first thing that comes to mind is 3D Printing. The assignment description was to print something that can be used for my final project or a small object that could not be easily made by subtractive methods. I remembered my lego piece I deigned in Week 2 from my Fusion360 tutorial and thought it would be a good starting point.

## Printing the Lego

 After opening the previous file I exported it as an STL file and sent it to the App Prusa Slicer! I resized my measurements and for the first attempt I rotated the image upsidedown while adding support structures. However, after 15 minutes of printing I realised that probably wasn't the best approach.

However, once I pulled off the support, the lego top, being so fragile, came off with it.

With the first attempt broken, I reprinted another but when the top layer was about to be printed, the bottom of the lego deattached from the plate so we had to stop the print and try again.

For the third attempt at printing out the lego I decided to rotate it back facing upwards and without the construction supports to avoid damaging it when I have to take the excess off. This would work because the top part is only one layer so it would be light enough to stay up without support. Additionally, I got help from my TA to turn the heat on the plate from 60 to 70 degrees to ensure the plastic would adhere. This was the successful piece!

## Scanning an Item

Along with the 3D printed item we had to scan something by using a photogammatry application. After searching through the app store I chose the app called Polycam. The app was compatitble with my iPhone 11 when using the basic capture function. I opened the app and used the video option to record a 360 view of a paper frog I had made while the app took 20 photos from the video to compile into a model.

After the pictures were done I simple had to click upload and waited for the app to process my photos. It them showed me a slightly distored but overall accurate image of the paper frog. I then used the crop tool to size down the photo and get rid of any background the app included, leaving me with the final scan!
