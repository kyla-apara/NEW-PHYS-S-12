  ### Week 5: 3D Design & Printing 

   This weeks project is 3D Printing! When saying digital fabrication the first thing that comes to mind is 3D Printing. The assignment description was to print something that can be used for my final project or a small object that could not be easily made by subtractive methods. I remembered my lego piece I deigned in Week 2 from my Fusion360 tutorial and thought it would be a good starting point. After opening the file I exported it as an STL file and sent it to the App Prusa Slicer! I resized my measurements and the first attempt layed the image upsidedown and added support structures.

  My current rough idea for my final project is a remote controlled cubical with sensory shelves that can help people with limited movement access supplies.
