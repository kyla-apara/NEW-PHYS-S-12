  # Week 12: Final Project Preparation

The Proposal: My first idea/rough sketch for my final project was a remote controlled cubical storage unit with sensory shelves. These shelves would be picked up by a robot that had the ability to sense where the person in need of help is and deliver any supplies to them. The goal is to help people with limited movement gain access to anything they might need. With the project, I plan to use it as a tool to help my mother easily have all her medical things (like pills) in one space and/or create something that is convenient and lots of people find useful.

Revised Proposal: After thinking more about what I want to do, and the time frame I have to make my project, I rethought my ideas and decided I would have to scale down. I decided to build a wireless/wifi controlled robot first and potentially add on to it later. By building the main robot I would be able to have at least something to present and still have a project that I can continue to work on in the future. 


## Current List of Materials & Machinery that I Need: 
(Most Things I Can Find in the Lab)

- Plywood

- Trays

- 3D Printer for the robot grabber

- Carboard (For Cubical Box)

- Paint

- Acrylic

- Battery pack

- Esp32

- Breadboard

- Different Wires

- Servo Motors


## Planning the workload:

July 12th: Detailed Robot Sketch Complete & CAD Files

July 14th: Main Components Done & Measurement Checks (Cubicals, Shelving Cut to Size and Any Resizing Adjustments)

July 19th: Start Making the Robot

July 27th: First Test Run

July 30th: Doing Test Runs and Minor Changes


## CAD Models

By using Fusion360 I designed and combined models to get a better look at what I might want my main components to look like! After redevoloping my ideas I have fully decided to add wheels to my robot and have it work similar to a forklift in warehouses. The robot would alig and attach itself with a shelf and then after the weight is removed it will put the shelf back.

## Creating Prototype 1

### [Take a look at Week 10: Machine Building!](../10_Machine_Building/index.html)


## Prototype 2

When I opened Prusa Slicer for the 3D Printer, I realised that the model for the scoup was too big. For this reason, I scaled the entire project down by 70% and then gathered more cardboard for the second prototype. The differnce in this prototype was the addtion of hinges where the hot glue was (because my actual scoup is 3D Printed and not carboard so it is not flexible) and the shape of the casing for my circuitry. I decided to enclose the wiring with rectangle pieces instead of square ones as the first protoype looked awkward. 


I still printed out my scoup whille building the resized protype. I got my finished scoup and lasercut and hot glue acrylic in order to make my tray.

After that was done I cut out 5, 142.24mm (5.6in) x 88.9mm (3.5in) rectangles and glued them together. I also reused my old simple wifi server code from [Week 9](../9_Radio_Wifi_Bluetooth/index.html) and adjusted the code as the original plan was to make the robot autonomous. I tried to make do with two wheels but quickly realised that it just would not be possible.

  <source src="Pro2.mp4" type="video/mp4">

After this test run, I decided to two more sets of wheels with another motor driver and it would make my robot alot more stable. I also taped down my circuitry, breadboard, and 5V powerbank and glued string to the cardboard, that was in place of my scoup, to the top of the robot as it would subsitute my sevo motors while doing more test runs.

Specifically, I edited my previous code as it was stacked with delay functions in a single button and did not have the most effcent layout. I combined a simple server template (provided by my teacher) and a series of commands for my motors that would control the wheels. This code allows me to click on one button for one function, and while it means the robot is not longer autonomous, I think this solution was better than the last.

After the code was done, I decicded to deconstruct this prototype and rebuild my real final model so I could transfer the wiring.

## Building the Final Model!

I cut light blue and white acrylic to form the sides and used hot glue to stick them together. For the top of the robot I used carpenters tape so I could take off the top and fix the wiring if it happened to get messed up. I hot glued my hinges onto my finished scoup and attached it to my base.
