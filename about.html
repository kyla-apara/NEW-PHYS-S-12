  ### About Me!

  Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kyla Apara, I am 16 years old and a rising junior at Somerset Academy Losee in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am excited to learn new things in my new Introduction to Digital Fabrication course at Harvard Summer School. I currently have no experience in digital fabrication or coding however, I do have an interest in art, design, and architecture. In my spare time I enjoy crochetting and participating on my school track team.
