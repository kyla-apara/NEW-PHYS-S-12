  # Week 3: Electronics & Tools 

  For Week 3, our assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture and include circuitry in order to make it move. We also had to use a multimeter to measure the voltages in our circuit and use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. I started thinking of ideas for my sculpture.

  ## Kinetic Sculpture

  I had many possible ideas for this project such as a wave simulator but, suddenly realized that the waves would look werid or be hard to reverse when we would have to spin it backwards. So, my chosen idea was inspiration from a classic ballernia music box. I decided I wanted to create it without the music, as the process would make it a lot more complicated for a newbie such as myself, and so I turned it into a jewlery stand instead. This was the very first sketch when coming up with the idea.

The first thing  did was create a new sketch. Since, the fully completed model was due the nxet day, I decided to go for a realtivly simple shape, that I could easily put together. Once in the new sketch on the XY plane I made a circumscribed polygon with 8 sides, or a simple octagon with a center point. Orginally, the size of this octagon had a radius of 117.80mm or 7 inches and edge length of 147.294mm. I envisoned the sides to be arranged to form an open faced box so the 8 side pieces had the same length of 147.294mm and a width of 101.6mm or 4 inches.

I extruded both the base and walls by 10cm as when cutting it out from cardboard with the laser cutter the 3D shape wouldn't come into play.
