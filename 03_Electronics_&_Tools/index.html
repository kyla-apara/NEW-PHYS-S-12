  # Week 3: Electronics & Tools 

  For Week 3, our assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture and include circuitry in order to make it move. We also had to use a multimeter to measure the voltages in our circuit and use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. I started thinking of ideas for my sculpture.

  ## Kinetic Sculpture

  I had many possible ideas for this project such as a wave simulator but, suddenly realized that the waves would look werid or be hard to reverse when we would have to spin it backwards. So, my chosen idea was inspiration from a classic ballernia music box. I decided I wanted to create it without the music, as the process would make it a lot more complicated for a newbie such as myself, and so I turned it into a jewlery stand instead. This was the very first sketch when coming up with the idea.

The first thing  did was create a new sketch. Since, the fully completed model was due the nxet day, I decided to go for a realtivly simple shape, that I could easily put together. Once in the new sketch on the XY plane I made a circumscribed polygon with 8 sides, or a simple octagon with a center point. Orginally, the size of this octagon had a radius of 117.80mm or 7 inches and edge length of 147.294mm. I envisoned the sides to be arranged to form an open faced box so I opened anoth sketch and created a 2 point rectangle. The soon to be side pieces had the same length of 147.294mm and a width of 101.6mm or 4 inches.

I extruded both the bases and walls by 10cm because, when cutting the shapes out from cardboard with the laser cutter, the 3D shape wouldn't come into play. After uploading my sketches from my flashdrive onto the computer for the laser cutter, I realised my measurements were seriously off and had to go back to adjust them. The new measurements for the box happened to be:

Octagon Radius: 88.9mm or 3.5 inches

Octagon Edge Length: 50.8mm or 2 inches

Rectangle Length: 50.8mm 

Rectangle Widgth: 73.647mm

Once this adustment was made I was able to easliy cut out my shapes and layed out all of my pieces. I also retrieved my motor that we previously soddered wires to from the last class, along with a wheel, that comes with the motors, to attach the second base as a platform for the main centerpiece.

Once the pieces were cut and I had the essensial parts I needed. I used hot glue and meticulously attached the pieces of my box together.

When I pieced the box together I realised that there was no place for the wires to be connected with the power source in order to make the structure move so, I decided to drill two holes in one of the sides to feed the ends of the wire through. Then, after feeding the wires through, I needed a way to get the top part of the motor to rotate without the other end of it spinning so, I used scrap cardboard pieces to make a mini structure for the motor to stay in place while turning. I cut a slightly looser hole in the top piece of cardboard so when the figure spins only the top prong connected to the wheel would move.
