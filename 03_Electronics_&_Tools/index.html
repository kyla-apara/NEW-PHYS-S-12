  # Week 3: Electronics & Tools 

  For Week 3, our assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture and include circuitry in order to make it move. We also had to use a multimeter to measure the voltages in our circuit and use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. I started thinking of ideas for my sculpture.

  ## Kinetic Sculpture

  I had many possible ideas for this project such as a wave simulator but, suddenly realized that the waves would look werid or be hard to reverse when we would have to spin it backwards. So, my chosen idea was inspiration from a classic ballernia music box. I decided I wanted to create it without the music, as the process would make it a lot more complicated for a newbie such as myself, and so I turned it into a jewlery stand instead. This was the very first sketch when coming up with the idea.
