  # Week 3: Electronics & Tools 

  For Week 3, our assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture and include circuitry in order to make it move. We also had to use a multimeter to measure the voltages in our circuit. and use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. I started thinking of ideas for my sculpture.

  I had many possible ideas for this project.
