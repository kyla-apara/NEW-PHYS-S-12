  # Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting!

For this weeks assignment we were tasked with designing something and make it using CNC (Computer Numerical Control). We had the option of usingthe ShopBot or Shaper (for 2D outlines), or the SRM-20 (for 2.5D molds). We also had to create something by molding and casting.


## CNC Milling w/ SRM-20

Originally I had decided to use my designs from Week 7 in order to create a mold for my trays in my final project. I quickly realised that this would be impossible given the size of the tray (7 inches) and the capacity of the SRM-20 (3 inches.) After looking at my options I decided that simply using the ShopBot to cut the tray parts individually from poly carbonate would be my best bet. Additionally, if I wanted to add the previous holes for my other robot model, I could do it with the Shaper. I exported my file as a DXF instead of an STL and took my flashdrive to the ShopBot.


## Molding & Casting

For the moldng and casting I decdied to create a mold for my wheels that the robot would use.
