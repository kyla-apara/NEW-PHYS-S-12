  # Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting!

For this weeks assignment we were tasked with designing something and make it using CNC (Computer Numerical Control). We had the option of using the ShopBot or Shaper (for 2D outlines), or the SRM-20 (for 2.5D objects). We also had to create something by molding and casting.


## CNC Milling w/ SRM-20

Originally I had decided to use my designs from Week 7 in order to create a mold for my trays in my final project. I quickly realised that this would be impossible given the size of the tray (7 inches) and the capacity of the SRM-20 (3 inches.) After looking at my options, I decided that molding the wheels for the little robot might be fun as I could continue to reuse the mold. So, I created my mold on fusion 360 an started with a 3 inch/ 76.2mm square.

Then, I extruded the mold by 30mm and created a new sketch on the top layer to make a hole for the silicone. I made a 66mm square and dragged the sketch down so it would barely touch the bottom (25mm) Here's the base of the mold.

After that was done, I created a new sketch in the middle of the hollowed cube and made a 2.5 inch/ 63.5mm circle in the center, it was extruded by 1 inch and had a 7mm x 4mm x 10cm rectangle in the middle for the motor prong to go into.

I then downloaded the file as an STL File and then took my flashdrive to the wax miller. When I first uploaded it I rotated the image 90 degrees on the X axis and hit the calculate button. I realised that the circle might have been too close to the edge of the square so, to be safe I resized the circle down to 2 inches/ 50.8mm and set the origin to the bottom left corner of the wax block after I had used constructors tape to secure it onto the bed. It was finally ready to mill.

After a painful 45 minutes the mold was finally ready to have silicone into it!

## Molding & Casting

Once the CNC milling was done I had to mold and cast something inside of the wax we just cut. First, to create the mold itself I mixed together equal parts of Part A and Part B of platinum cure silicone rubber, trying my best to not lift the mixing stick to avoid creating air bubbles. I slowly and precisly poured the mixture into the wax mold and left it overnight to cure.

The next day I pulled out the silicone from the wax and had my mold for the wheels ready to use!

I quickly found some resin, put on gloves as a precaution, and poured in equal parts of Part A and Part B. While mixing it I realised there was an insane amount of bubbles but I was clueless as to what could have caused it. I poured in the resin anyways and spent 20 minutes simply flicking the sides of the mold to pop the majority of them. The bubbles around the sides had dissapeared but the other ones had floated to the middle. I grabbed a toothpick and scouped them out, which I am not sure was the best idea, but it got the job done. Unfortunatly there was no gold flakes or flowers to put in it so I left it clear and I waited for the 24-48 hour time period so it can cure. Heres the finished wheel!
