  ### Week 1: Introduction & About Me

   Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kyla Apara, I am 16 years old and a junior from Las Vegas, Nevada. This website serves as a recap of what I have created in my Introduction to Digital Fabrication course at Harvard Summer School! The Harvard SSP Program lasted for 7 weeks where I was able to live on campus and get a hands on experience. Before this class I had no prior experience in digital fabrication or computer science however, I have an large interest in design, art, architecture, and engeneering. In my spare time I enjoy crochetting, participating on my school track team and asl club, and spending time with my family. Specifically, I like hanging out with my mom, who is my biggest supporter and constantly encourages me to challenge myself, this is us!
